> Respond to changes in a DOM element's size.

This package provides you with:

* a [`<Provider>`](/docs/api.md#provider) to instantiate the ResizeObserver;
* an [`<Observe>`](/docs/api.md#observe) component to detect changes in an observed DOM element;
* a [`useBreakpoints()`](/docs/api.md#usebreakpoints) hook to change a child component's behaviour based on the width and height of the nearest parent `<Observe>`.

For power users it also provides:
* a [`<Context>`](/docs/api.md#context) on which you can assign a `ResizeObserverEntry` value to trigger any nested components that are using `useBreakpoints()`;
* a [`useResizeObserver()`](/docs/api.md#useresizeobserver) hook to access the instantiated `ResizeObserver` on `<Provider>`;
* a [`useResizeObserverEntry()`](/docs/api.md#useresizeobserverentry) hook to retrieve the `ResizeObserverEntry` put on the nearest `<Context>`. This is what `useBreakpoints()` uses under the hood.

This allows you to change the evaluated logic and rendered output of a component. For example, you can change a dropdown menu to a horizontal list menu based on its parent container's width without using CSS media queries.

# Developer status

While this package has seen little action "in the wild", it has first been developed and groomed elsewhere. As such, I don't expect a lot of changes conceptually. However, the API of this hook is not finalised and may change at any given time.

# Quick start

Follow these steps to get started with `react-breakpoints`. This is the **minimum required setup** and is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Check out the [API Docs](/docs/api.md) for all options.

```shell
npm install @envato/react-breakpoints
```

## Set up the Provider

```javascript
import { Provider as ResizeObserverProvider } from '@envato/react-breakpoints';

const App = () => (
  <ResizeObserverProvider>
    ...
  </ResizeObserverProvider>
)
```

⚠️ **Caution**: You may need to provide some props to `<Provider>` to increase browser support. Please refer to the [API Docs](/docs/api.md#provider).

## Observe an element

```javascript
import { Observe } from '@envato/react-breakpoints';

<Observe
  render={({ observedElementProps }) => (
    <aside {...observedElementProps}>
      <MyResponsiveComponent />
    </aside>
  )}
/>
```

## Consume the observation

```javascript
import { useBreakpoints } from '@envato/react-breakpoints';

const MyResponsiveComponent = () => {
  const options = {
    widths: {
      0: 'mobile',
      769: 'tablet',
      1025: 'desktop'
    }
  };

  const [label] = useBreakpoints(options);

  return (
    <div className={label}>
      This element is currently within the {label} range.
    </div>
  );
};
```

See the [API Docs](/docs/api.md) for reference guides and usage examples.
